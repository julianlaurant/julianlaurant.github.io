        <h2>Core values and beliefs</h2>
        <p>I care deeply about advancing freedom, both for myself and for others. To me, that means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating a world where no person is forced to choose between sacrificing their own health or happiness, or not being able to provide for themselves and their families</li>
            <li>Helping people better understand what their core wants and needs are. Giving people better mental & emotional tools for resolving conflicting internal desires</li>
            <li>Advancing our understanding of the world itself, the consequences of our actions, and the consequences of our wants</li>
        </ul>

        <p>On a more concrete level, I want to see progress in the following areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Overall welfare and prosperity:
                <ul>
                    <li>General quality of life: health-adjusted life expectancy; life satisfaction; material prosperity; free time</li>
                    <li>Education & access to information. Empowering people to make informed choices about their life</li>
                    <li>Civil liberties, rule of law and nondiscrimination</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Reducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk">global catastrophic risks</a> like climate change, nuclear war, and potential risks from artificial intelligence</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Personal</h2>
        <p>In my free time, I like spending time with friends, reading, travel and adventure sports.</p>
