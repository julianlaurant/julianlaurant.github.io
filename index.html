        <h2>Core values and beliefs</h2>
        I care deeply about advancing freedom, both for myself and for others. To me, that means:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating a world where no person is forced to choose between sacrificing their own health or happiness, or not being able to provide for themselves and their families</li>
            <li>Helping people better understand what their core wants and needs are. Giving people better mental & emotional tools for resolving conflicting internal desires</li>
            <li>Advancing our understanding of the world itself, the consequences of our actions, and the consequences of our wants</li>
        </ul>

        On a more concrete level, I want to see progress in the following areas:<br>
        <ul>
            <li> Overall welfare and prosperity:
                <ul>
                    <li>General quality of life: health-adjusted life expectancy; life satisfaction; material prosperity; free time</li>
                    <li>Education & access to information. Empowering people to make informed choices about their life</li>
                    <li>Civil liberties, rule of law and nondiscrimination</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Reducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk">global catastrophic risks</a> like climate change, nuclear war, large-scale pandemics and potential risks from artificial intelligence</li>
            <li> Designing institutions, processes and tools that effectively support the above two areas
                <ul>
                    <li>Improving the full science & technological development cycle, from fundamental research to commercialization and deployment</li>
                    <li>Creating better governance structures</li>
                    <li>Reforming the education system</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>My current work ultimately aims to create human-level artificial intelligence that is aligned with human values, and ensure that the benefits of that technology are distributed broadly across the whole of humanity.</p>

        <h2>Personal</h2>
